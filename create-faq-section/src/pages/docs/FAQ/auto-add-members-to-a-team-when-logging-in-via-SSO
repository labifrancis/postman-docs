When a team sets up their Postman instance to be accessed using SSO and access to be controlled via Active Directory Groups, they can set it to auto-add members. There is an option to "Allow Signups” during the SSO setup process to eliminate the application still requiring a manual invitation to be sent from an admin to users. Another option is to select the “auto add to team'“ option in the team’s authentication settings.
